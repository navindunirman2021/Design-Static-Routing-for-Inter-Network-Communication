**Design  Static Routing for Inter-Network Communication**

**Project Overview:**
In this project, I was tasked with setting up static routing across multiple routers to enable communication between distinct IP subnets. The goal was to configure a network with five routers and establish static routes between them to allow two remote PCs to communicate across different subnets. This project helped me gain hands-on experience in static IP addressing and routing.

**Key Responsibilities and Achievements:**

**Router Configuration:**
Configured five Cisco routers (R1 to R5), assigning IP addresses to the router interfaces based on a predefined addressing scheme. Each router was equipped with two Ethernet interfaces to manage different IP subnets, ensuring seamless routing across the network.

**Static Routing Setup:**
Added static routing entries on each router to ensure proper packet forwarding between remote subnets. Configured each router's routing table to include direct paths to remote networks, enabling inter-network communication.

**PC Configuration:**
Configured two PCs (PC1 and PC2) with static IP addresses, ensuring they were correctly placed in the respective subnets for communication. Set up the PCs to use the appropriate default gateway to ensure successful routing.

**Testing and Validation:**
Conducted thorough testing by pinging the two PCs from each other, verifying that the routing configuration allowed successful communication across the routers. Ensured that each static route was correctly implemented and that no routing loops or errors existed in the setup.

**Troubleshooting and Optimization:**
Identified and corrected any issues with the routing configuration, ensuring that all routers were correctly routing packets to their destinations without delay or packet loss. The project provided insights into the importance of precise static routing for effective network communication.

**Technologies Used:**

Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and configuration.

Cisco Routers (Cisco 1941) for routing setup and IP configuration.

Static Routing to manually define routes between subnets.
